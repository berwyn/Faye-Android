Apps

Got an app that uses this library? Drop me a line and I'll feature it here!

Documentation
=============

I know, there is none. I promise I'll get some quick setup documentation here soon!
For now, simply bind the service using its onBind(), then use the public methods the client provides :)

Todo
====

1. Documentation
2. Threading, she's pretty heavy right now
3. Clean up code, remove old stuff
